                    <h2>What Does Home Insurance Cover?</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Dwelling Coverage</h3>
                    <p>This is the foundation of your homeowners policy. Dwelling coverage protects the physical structure of your home, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Walls, roof, and foundation</li>
                        <li>Built-in appliances and fixtures</li>
                        <li>Attached structures like garages</li>
                        <li>Plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Coverage typically includes damage from fire, lightning, windstorms, hail, and other covered perils.</p>

                    <h3>Personal Property Coverage</h3>
                    <p>Protects your belongings inside your home, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Furniture and appliances</li>
                        <li>Clothing and jewelry</li>
                        <li>Electronics and computers</li>
                        <li>Sports equipment</li>
                        <li>Tools and lawn equipment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This coverage extends to items temporarily away from home, such as luggage on vacation.</p>

                    <h3>Liability Protection</h3>
                    <p>Liability coverage protects you financially if someone is injured on your property or if you accidentally damage someone else's property. It covers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medical expenses for injured guests</li>
                        <li>Legal defense costs if you're sued</li>
                        <li>Court judgments and settlements</li>
                        <li>Damage you cause to others' property</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Additional Living Expenses (ALE)</h3>
                    <p>If your home becomes uninhabitable due to a covered loss, ALE coverage pays for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hotel or rental accommodation costs</li>
                        <li>Restaurant meals (above normal food costs)</li>
                        <li>Storage fees for belongings</li>
                        <li>Additional transportation expenses</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Other Structures Coverage</h3>
                    <p>Protects structures on your property that aren't attached to your home:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Detached garages and sheds</li>
                        <li>Fences and gates</li>
                        <li>Gazebos and pergolas</li>
                        <li>Swimming pools</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Types of Home Insurance Policies</h2>
                    
                    <h3>HO-3 (Special Form) - Most Common</h3>
                    <p>The most popular homeowners policy provides comprehensive "all-risk" coverage for your dwelling and named-peril coverage for personal property. This means your home is covered for all perils except those specifically excluded.</p>

                    <h3>HO-5 (Premier Coverage)</h3>
                    <p>Premium coverage that protects both your dwelling and personal property on an "all-risk" basis, offering the most comprehensive protection available.</p>

                    <h3>HO-4 (Renters Insurance)</h3>
                    <p>For renters, this policy covers personal belongings and liability but not the building structure, which is the landlord's responsibility.</p>

                    <h3>HO-6 (Condo Insurance)</h3>
                    <p>Designed for condo owners, covering interior improvements, personal property, and liability. The condo association's master policy covers common areas.</p>

                    <h3>HO-8 (Older Home Insurance)</h3>
                    <p>Specialized coverage for older or historic homes where replacement cost would exceed market value.</p>

                    <h2>Additional Coverage Options</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Flood Insurance</h3>
                    <p>Standard homeowners policies don't cover flood damage. If you live in a flood-prone area, separate flood insurance is essential. We can help you obtain coverage through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or private insurers.</p>

                    <h3>Earthquake Coverage</h3>
                    <p>Earthquake damage isn't covered by standard policies. If you live in an earthquake zone, we can add this important protection.</p>

                    <h3>Water Backup Coverage</h3>
                    <p>Protects against damage from sewers or drains backing up into your home—a common and costly problem not covered by standard policies.</p>

                    <h3>Scheduled Personal Property</h3>
                    <p>Provides additional coverage for high-value items like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Jewelry and watches</li>
                        <li>Fine art and collectibles</li>
                        <li>Musical instruments</li>
                        <li>Expensive electronics</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Identity Theft Coverage</h3>
                    <p>Helps cover expenses related to restoring your identity if you become a victim of identity theft.</p>

                    <h3>Home Business Coverage</h3>
                    <p>If you run a business from home, standard policies provide limited coverage. We can add endorsements or separate policies to protect your business equipment and liability.</p>

                    <h2>Factors Affecting Your Home Insurance Rate</h2>
                    <p>Several factors influence your homeowners insurance premium:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Crime rates, weather risks, and proximity to fire stations</li>
                        <li><strong>Home Age and Condition:</strong> Newer homes with updated systems cost less to insure</li>
                        <li><strong>Construction Type:</strong> Brick or stone is less expensive than wood frame</li>
                        <li><strong>Coverage Amount:</strong> Higher coverage limits increase premiums</li>
                        <li><strong>Deductible:</strong> Higher deductibles lower your premium</li>
                        <li><strong>Claims History:</strong> Fewer claims mean lower rates</li>
                        <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> Better credit often results in lower premiums</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    
                    <h3>How much home insurance coverage do I need?</h3>
                    <p>Your dwelling coverage should be enough to rebuild your home at current construction costs. We recommend replacement cost coverage rather than actual cash value. Our agents will help you determine the right amount based on your home's features and local building costs.</p>

                    <h3>What's not covered by home insurance?</h3>
                    <p>Standard policies typically exclude floods, earthquakes, normal wear and tear, and maintenance issues. We can help you add coverage for these risks through endorsements or separate policies.</p>

                    <h3>Should I choose replacement cost or actual cash value?</h3>
                    <p>Replacement cost coverage pays to replace items at today's prices, while actual cash value deducts depreciation. We strongly recommend replacement cost coverage for both your dwelling and personal property.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need home insurance if I own my home outright?</h3>
                    <p>Even without a mortgage, home insurance is crucial to protect your investment and assets from lawsuits and disasters. Your home is likely your largest financial asset—protect it!</p>

                    <h3>Can I get home insurance with a previous claim?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! While claims can affect your rate, we work with multiple carriers to find you coverage at competitive prices, even with a claims history.</p>
